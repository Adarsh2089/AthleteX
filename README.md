# 🏃‍♂️ AthletiX – Empowering Athletes. Elevating Sports.

## 📱 Project Overview

**AthletiX** is an AI-powered Android application designed to revolutionize how athletes train, perform, and grow.

## 💡 The Problem We're Solving

Athletes face countless challenges — lack of proper training insights, preventable injuries, expensive coaching, and limited exposure to sponsorships or tournaments. Meanwhile, coaches struggle to monitor multiple athletes remotely and provide timely feedback.

- Real-time posture tracking to reduce injury risks.
- Automated performance tracking with wearable data.
- Emergency SOS alerts during critical situations.
- A connected ecosystem for athletes, coaches, and sponsors.
- A digital platform to access tournaments, funding, and mentorship.
